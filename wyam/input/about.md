Title: About Me
---

I am a software developer based in Sofia, Bulgaria.  
I work mostly on backend stuff although I like being involved in the full development lifecycle.  

Currently working as Principal Software Developer at [Fourth](https://www.fourth.com).

I love fantasy books and reading in general. Also like hiking, jogging and movies.
